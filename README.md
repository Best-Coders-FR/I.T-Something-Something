# I.T-Something-Something
# Pico W Temperature-to-Sound Project
## Project Overview

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a sound that changes frequency based on the temperature. As the temperature increases, the sound frequency produced by the Pico W also increases, creating an audible indication of temperature changes.

Features
Real-time temperature monitoring
Frequency output changes with temperature
Setup
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi Pico W
Temperature sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22, or built-in sensor if available)
Speaker or buzzer for sound output
Jumper wires for connections
