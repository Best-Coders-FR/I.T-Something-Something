## Pico W Temperature-to-Sound Project
### Project Overview

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a sound that changes frequency based on the temperature. As the temperature increases, the sound frequency produced by the Pico W also increases, creating an audible indication of temperature changes.

### Features Include:

Real-time temperature monitoring
Frequency output changes with temperature

### Setup and Requirements

###### - Hardware Requirements
###### - Raspberry Pi Pico W
###### - Temperature sensor (built-in sensor)
###### - Speaker or buzzer for sound output
###### - Jumper wires for connections

### Purpose

###### - The purpose of this project is to create a simple but intuitive, home audio-based temperature monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi Pico W. By increasing sound frequency with rising temperatures, the project provides a unique way to "hear" temperature changes in real time. This makes it useful in various scenarios, such as:

###### - Overheating Alert: In areas like kitchens, attics, or around appliances, this device can signal rising temperatures that may indicate overheating, potentially preventing fire hazards.
###### - Cold Snap Notification: In cold environments or unheated rooms, a drop in sound frequency could warn of dangerously low temperatures, helping prevent freezing conditions that might damage pipes or endanger health.
###### - Room Temperature Monitoring: This project can monitor rooms with sensitive items (like a greenhouse or wine cellar) where temperature fluctuations need to be kept within a specific range.
